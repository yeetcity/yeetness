        <p>Steve Wozniak is one of the lesser known contributors to world of technology andcomputing. Many people know of the iconic brand “Apple” and a majority of them know that Steve Jobs was a major contributor to the Apple Dynasty. However most are not familiar with the Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, AKA “The Woz”, who played a major part in the creation of the largely known company. Although steve jobs is credited with most of Apple's success when the company started in 1976, Without Steve Wozniak the company, quite arguably, may have never existed.</p>
        
        <p> Steve Wozniak was born in San Jose California on August 11, 1950. His father was an electrical engineer which sparked his interest for technology at an early age. Throughout his childhood Mr. Wozniak was a very bright child/teenager winning many award through his public school career. Inevitably he moved on to college after he graduated high school. Originally he attended the University of Colorado for his freshman year, however his parents were not able to keep paying for the high, out-of-state tuition. He ended up back in a community college in California for a short period of time before going to the University of California, Berkley for his senior year of school. Here is where he met Steve Jobs and began concocting the idea for the Apple Company</p>
        
        <p>Eventually the two tech geniuses launched the Apple company. With minimal funds and working out of Job’s family Garage the first step towards the apple computer was taken.Originally, Wozniak had created a computer design while working his night job at HP and Jobs that the design would be a huge success and asked Wozniak if he could market it. At the time the two founders of Apple were not worried about making a bunch of money they were more so intrigued with the concept of owning a business. After they had sold almost all of their possessions to accomodate for startup costs and supplies they finally received an order for $50,000 worth of their first Apple computer.
</p>
            
            <p>With the small success of their first big sale both partners in the company continued tobuild the Apple brand, and product. They Began to work on the second Apple computer. WhileJobs was mainly focused on aesthetic and marketing, Wozniak was engineering the an entirel ynew type of computer that would change the way technology world for years to come. Wozniak was said to be addicted to computers and during this time in his life is when it truly showed. He began the design of the Apple II computer with the idea in mind that it would be user friendly to everyone, not just the tech geeks. He wanted to implement a graphical display as opposed to the time-standard command prompt. The idea eventually came to fruition with the Woz creating and implementing new technology that allowed for high resolution color graphics (6 colors) that could be displayed to a standard cathode box monitor. To this day the patents for this technology is all in his name under the Apple company. Ultimately with this discovery came the concept of having a seperate microcomputer for the purpose of video display. In addition to making leaps and bounds in the directions of user access as well as displays, a year later Mr. Wozniak created a version of the floppy disk that would be available to all users to purchase and store memory on. With all of the wheels in motion for the second apple computer Jobs and Wozniak were ready to release it to the public.The computer became available in June of 1977. Combined with Wozniak's’ genius inventions and Jobs marketing skills the computer was a huge success that would act as the solid foundation for the Apple company we know today. The company sold approximately 5.5 million units with an average price of around $1300. By 1983 Apple had a stock value of 985 million dollars. </p>
        
            <p>By 1985 the Apple company was more than well running, this being the case Steve Wozniak was no longer satisfied with day to day life of the company. He decided to leave the company and sell most of his stocks. Even though he had left the company that he had built from the ground up and was more than financially sound, The woz could not stay away from innovation the tech realm. He Eventually Founded the CL9 company that were the makers of the very first programmable universal remote which is a largely used item as well as technology concept. His Latest hardware invention was in 2006 which was named the “Wheels Of Zeus” (WOZ) which never came to fruition however was one of the first concepts of an attachable, Wireless GPS device.
</p>
            <p>Needless to say, Steve Wozniak was a staple in the world of technology. He has gave a large portion of his life to improving the way the public uses and sees computers and technology. As a generation, we are truly lucky to have someone like this in our lifetime who continues to give back to the future entrepreneurs of the technology and computing industry.</p>
